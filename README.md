# UFOs 

Module 11 Project

## Overview

This project is to satisfy the requirements for the 11th module challenge in the Data Analytics Bootcamp.
In this module, Dana is creating a website for others to learn more about UFO sightings. This project utilizes
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to make an interactive webpage. The user can input different key aspects to filter the information table.

### Snapshot of the Webpage

## Results

* After reading the Intro, there is a table of UFO Sightings. That table can be filtered by five different aspects.

* Filters can be used on an individual basis or all together. 
* As each entry is made, the table will automatically filter to the user's choice after clicking enter, tab, or just outside the cell.
* The table will display as empty if the criteria is not able to be met.

## Summary

- One of the drawbacks of the webpage is that it is not live data. As you can see, the data is rather old.
- That would be one of my recommendations. Connect to an API or a more current data source.
- The next recommendation would be to have links to other sites that promote UFO discussions.
